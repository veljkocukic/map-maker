# How to use

Click on the map to place the marker and right click on the marker to remove it. When you click on the existing
marker, its color changes. In the textarea you can put input like this:

    40.689292,-74.044507,red
    40.701464,-74.015501,blue

and the markers with those coordinates will be placed on the map (color is optional)
